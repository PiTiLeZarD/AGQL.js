# AGQL.js

This is a toy project for now. But the idea would be Supabase/Firebase meet GraphQL.

Many of my project ideas have graphql at the core and I always end up wasting a lot of time setting everything up when all I need is a ready to use database and a schema builder.

So this is an attempt at solving that issue and as with all projects, an attemps at pushing my own limits.

I will update this readme if anything interesting happens but for now

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Will get you the server running with a basic homepage and an even more basic /backend/graphql, /backend/graphql/playground setup.
